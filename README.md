Imports: TensorFlow libraries for image processing, model building, and data augmentation.
Data paths: Define paths for training, validation, and test data directories.
Image dimensions: Set the image width and height for resizing images.
Data augmentation: Define data generators for training and validation data with augmentation techniques.
Data loading: Load training and validation data using the generators with class labels (categorical).
Pre-trained model: Load VGG16 pre-trained model with weights from ImageNet, excluding the final classification layers. (Replace with a different model if desired).
Freezing pre-trained layers: (Optional) Freeze the pre-trained layers to prevent them from retraining (fine-tuning approach).
Custom layers: Add custom layers (Flatten, Dense, Dropout) for feature extraction and classification specific to your 67 scene categories.
Model creation: Create a final model using the pre-trained base and the custom layers.
Model compilation: Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.
Training: Train

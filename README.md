Imports: TensorFlow libraries for image processing, model building, and data augmentation.
Data paths: Define paths for training, validation, and test data directories.
Image dimensions: Set the image width and height for resizing images.
Data augmentation: Define data generators for training and validation data with augmentation techniques.
Data loading: Load training and validation data using the generators with class labels (categorical).
Pre-trained model: Load VGG16 pre-trained model with weights from ImageNet, excluding the final classification layers. (Replace with a different model if desired).
Freezing pre-trained layers: (Optional) Freeze the pre-trained layers to prevent them from retraining (fine-tuning approach).
Custom layers: Add custom layers (Flatten, Dense, Dropout) for feature extraction and classification specific to your 67 scene categories.
Model creation: Create a final model using the pre-trained base and the custom layers.
Model compilation: Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.
Training: Train

Het kan beter nog volgens Gemini
You're right, there's room for improvement in the provided code to potentially increase scene recognition accuracy. Here are some ways to enhance it:

1. Utilize Attention Mechanism:

Modify the custom layers section to include an attention mechanism layer after the first Dense layer (Dense(1024, activation='relu')). This can focus the model on informative regions of the image for scene classification. Explore libraries like tensorflow.keras.layers.Attention for implementation.
2. Experiment with a Deeper Network:

Consider replacing VGG16 with a deeper pre-trained model like InceptionV3 or ResNet-101. These models have a higher capacity for learning complex features potentially leading to better performance. However, be mindful of overfitting with a limited dataset.
3. Class Imbalance Handling:

If your dataset has a significant class imbalance, incorporate techniques to address it. You can modify the data generators to oversample minority classes or implement class weighting during model compilation. Libraries like tensorflow.keras.utils.to_categorical provide options for class weighting.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning:

The provided code uses basic hyperparameters. Utilize techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal combination of learning rate, optimizer (e.g., SGD with momentum), batch size, and number of training epochs.
Here's an example incorporating an attention mechanism:

Python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Attention

# ... rest of the code (until custom layers section)

x = base_model.output
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
x = Attention()([x, x])  # Add attention layer here
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
predictions = Dense(67, activation='softmax')(x)

# ... rest of the code (model creation, compilation, training)
